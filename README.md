<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Humanities at Tsinghua University. My major is computational linguistics, combining artificial intelligence and natural languages. I am interested in computational lexical semantics (including polysemy, ambiguity and uncertainty), semantic map models and AI interpretability for LLMs.
