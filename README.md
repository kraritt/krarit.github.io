## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Humanities at Tsinghua University. My major is computational linguistics, combining artificial intelligence and natural languages.

I am interested in:
- Computational lexical semantics (including polysemy, ambiguity and uncertainty)
- Semantic map models
- AI interpretability for LLMs
