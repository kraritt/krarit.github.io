    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Humanities at Tsinghua University. My major is computational linguistics,
        combining artificial intelligence and natural languages. I am interested in computational lexical semantics
        (including polysemy, ambiguity and uncertainty), semantic map models and AI interpretability for LLMs.
